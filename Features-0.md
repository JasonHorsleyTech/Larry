Features I want to add. As I finish, moving each to README.md#features

# What I want from Larry

High level, I want Larry to be a drop-in base chat bot. I want some "out the box" features, some that can be customized, all while exposing a reasonable generalized structure for "Siri on my Saas".

#### Out the box
- [ ] Converse
- [ ] Inquire
- [ ] Feature requests

#### Some configuration
- [ ] Navigate
- [ ] Autoform
- [ ] Autoform with assistant
- [ ] Audit
- [ ] Execute

#### Framework
- [ ] Better Inquire
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Admin visibility (cost and prompts)
- [ ] WalkieTalkie, JS only.
