# Larry

Apple has Siri, Amazon has Alexa, and Laravel needs Larry. Larry is a voice-directed virtual assistant powered by GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), providing a more structured and opinionated way for a stack to converse with GPT.

## Features

Here's a hopeful list of features that Larry is intended to implement:

### Converse

Talk directly into your phone's mic, and Larry transcribes your words into text. This can be achieved either by free browser tools or external resources. With Larry, you can engage in open-ended conversations that are contextually sensitive and stylistically unique.

### Formfill

With Larry, you can convert your speech to a prefilled form. It listens to your dictation, converts the speech into text, then into JSON, and finally populates the form. If the information is partial, Larry can engage in followup questions to complete the form.

### Navigate

Larry provides site navigation functionality by converting your speech into site navigation commands. Wherever you need to be on the site, Larry can help get you there while maintaining the proper state.

### Inquire

Larry allows for on-the-fly analytics. Your speech is converted to a raw SQL query, and Larry returns the result. Quick insights into your data have never been easier. Check out more details here.

### Audit

Larry can perform nightly audits, executing slow-sort queries overnight and greeting you with results the next morning. It can be configured as a cron job to handle resource-intensive tasks outside of peak hours.

### Execute

Larry supports reversible actions. It can initiate voice-triggered actions that execute either after a specified timer or upon the next interaction, assuming no objections. This adds an extra layer of convenience and control to your interactions with the application.

Larry is an ongoing project, and any suggestions or contributions are welcome.
